## 📝 Project Description

This project is a **Personal Portfolio Website** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and the **Handlebars (HBS)** view engine.  
The website includes four main pages — **Home**, **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact Me** — designed to showcase my skills, background, and sample work in a clean, professional layout.

The site structure and routing follow the conventions of the **Express Generator** tool, and it uses a **shared layout template** to include consistent navigation, header, and footer across all pages.

The project demonstrates the use of:
- Express routing and controllers  
- HBS templating engine  
- Bootstrap styling and responsive design  
- Cloud deployment on Render (for live hosting)  
- Git version control with descriptive commits
